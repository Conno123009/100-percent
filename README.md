# 100-percent

A game completion checklist and guide

Started off as a Ocarina of Time Golden Skulltula guide and checklist but expanded it to add a general 100% checklist for OOT.

All (most) the information is loaded from JSON files at runtime. It all works, but could be rewritten better and whatnot.

It only has Ocarina of Time at the moment, but has everything set up for expansion.

Pull requests, including backend improvements or new games, etc. are welcome and appreciated.
